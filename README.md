# 3D Helicopter Simulation

This project is a 3D simulation of a helicopter flying in a box-filled environment. The simulation is built using WebGL and JavaScript, and allows the user to control the movement of the helicopter and adjust the camera view to see the environment from different angles.

## Features

- Realistic 3D rendering of a helicopter and boxes using WebGL
- User control of the helicopter's movement and motor velocity
- Adjustable camera view for a better perspective of the environment
- Dynamic environment with boxes that move and interact with the helicopter

## Usage

To run the simulation, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the helicopter and the space bar to adjust the motor velocity. The mouse can be used to change the camera view and zoom in or out.

The settings for the simulation can be adjusted using the GUI controls in the top-right corner of the screen. The options include changing the speed of the simulation, setting the ceiling height, and controlling the properties of the helicopter and boxes.
